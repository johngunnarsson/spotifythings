SpotifyThings
=============

Welcome to the home of SpotifyThings.
An open source Spotify music player that associate things with music using RFID.

This project is a piece of software that preferably runs on an embedded device such as a Raspberry Pi with an RFID Reader attached to it.
Via the build in web application you associate albums, tracks or playlist to a rfid-tag.
To play the music associated with the tag you simply put it near the rfid reader.

The software uses spotify to play music. The currently only supported rfid reader is the one from Phidgets.
